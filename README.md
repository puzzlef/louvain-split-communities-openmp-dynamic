Design of OpenMP-based Parallel [Louvain algorithm][Louvain] for [community detection], \
with no internally-disconnected communities.

<br>

Community detection entails the identification of clusters of vertices that exhibit stronger connections within themselves compared to the wider network. The Louvain method, a commonly utilized heuristic for this task, employs a two-step process comprising a local-moving phase and an aggregation phase. This process iteratively optimizes the modularity metric, a measure of community quality. Although widely used, the Louvain method has been noted for generating internally-disconnected and poorly connected communities. In response, Traag et al. introduce the Leiden algorithm, which incorporates an extra refinement phase between the local-moving and aggregation phases. This refinement step enables vertices to explore and potentially create sub-communities within the identified communities from the local-moving phase. In this report, we propose another BFS-based approach, **GSP-Louvain**, for addressing the same issue. This is different from a number of earlier works, which tackled internally-disconnected communities as a post-processing step.

Below we plot the time taken by the [original Leiden], [igraph] Leiden, [NetworKit] Leiden, GSP-Louvain on 13 different graphs. GSP-Louvain surpasses the original Leiden, igraph Leiden, and NetworKit Leiden by `341√ó`, `83√ó`, and `6.1√ó` respectively, achieving a processing rate of `328M` edges/s on a `3.8ùêµ` edge graph.

Below we plot the speedup of GSP-Louvain wrt original Leiden, igraph Leiden, and NetworKit Leiden.

Next, we compare the modularity of communities identified by the original Leiden algorithm, igraph Leiden, NetworKit Leiden, and GSP-Louvain. On average, GSP-Louvain achieves `0.3%` lower modularity than the original Leiden and igraph Leiden, respectively, and `25%` higher modularity than NetworKit Leiden, particularly evident on road networks and protein k-mer graphs.

Finally, we plot the fraction of disconnected communities identified by each implementation. Absence of bars indicates the absence of disconnected communities. The original Leiden, igraph Leiden, and GSP-Louvain do not identify any communities that are internally-disconnected. However, on average, NetworKit Leiden exhibit fraction of disconnected communities amounting to `1.5√ó10^‚àí2`, particularly on web graphs and social networks.
